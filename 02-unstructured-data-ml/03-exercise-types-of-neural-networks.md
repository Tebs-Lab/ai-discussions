# Exercise: 

There are many kinds of neural networks, in this exercise you're going to be asked to do some basic research to determine what kinds of neural networks there are and what types of tasks they excel at. Later, we'll dive into several specific neural network types, so try to focus on the high level concepts here.

## The questions:

Answer the following questions for each of the following types of neural network:

* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks
* Transformers
* Generative Adversarial Networks

1. What type of task is this family of neural networks most suited to?
    * What type(s) of input data will be used?
    * What type(s) of output data will be produced?
    * Can you find any examples of a specific task this type of network is used to solve?
2. What is the key distinguishing feature of this type of network?
    * What is the benefit of this key feature?
3. Can you find any major drawbacks or issues that must be addressed when using this type of network?
