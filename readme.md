# AI Discussions For Everyone

Artificial Intelligence is now all but ubiquitous. Computer systems now fill our daily lives with suggestions: which roads to take, which things to buy, which movies to watch, and so much more. AI also powers automated surveillance systems, makes sentencing recommendations, informs hiring managers, and powers weapon systems. From the frivolous to the momentous, AI is everywhere. Because of this, an understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of AI cannot be sequestered to the engineers building these systems. 

The materials in this repository are meant to drive meaningful lectures and discussions about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the larger software systems based on this technology.

This class attempts to address the theoretical underpinnings of modern AI systems, as well as the social implications of the deployment of such systems. While some of the topics are technical in nature, the purpose of these materials is explicitly to target a general audience, as such there are no prerequisite knowledge expectations.

## Running a Class With These Materials

Running a class should be fairly straight forward! All of the materials are ordered, with exercises (mostly in the form of small-group discussions) interspersed throughout. This class works best with slightly larger class sizes so that group sizes and the membership/makeup of groups can be changed for each exercise.

The basic pattern of class is:

1. 30-45 minutes of lecture.
2. Break into smaller groups for 30-45 minutes of discussion.
3. Bring students together for 15-30 minutes of full class discussion.
4. Repeat.

That said, the lesson plans and lecture notes are designed with the assumption that a relative expert is running the class. As such, these materials may not be as useful for those wishing to self-study these topics.
