# Exercise: Research Specific GAN Architectures

In this exercise you'll be broken into small teams and asked to research well known architectures for certain types of problems.

## The Questions

Answer the following questions for each of the following tasks:

* Image Generation
* Style Transfer 
* Inpainting 
* Resolution upscaling

1. Can you find the name of an architecture that is current and popular for this task?
    * When was this architecture first used/described?
    * Can you find examples of specific tasks it has had success on?
    * Are there any key data-preprocessing steps that must be applied?
2. Can you find an image representing this architecture?
3. Try to describe the key features of this architecture...
    * What are the architectures of the discriminator and generator?
    * Is the latent space just random or is it being controlled somehow (e.g. a conditional GAN)?
