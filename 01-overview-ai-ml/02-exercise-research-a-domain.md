# Exercise: Research a Subdomain

In this exercise you'll be divided into small teams (2-3 people) then asked to:

* Pick an AI topic.
* Perform some research related to that topic.

## Pick a Topic (less than 5 minutes):

Here is a medium length (and non-exhaustive) list of subdomains and applications of AI. You may choose one of these, or explore another topic that interests you:

A short list of possible topics:

* Computer vision.
    * Facial recognition.
    * Content moderation.
    * Self operating vehicles.
    * Automated surveillance.
    * Medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g. cancer screening)  
    
    
* Natural language processing.
    * Language translation.
    * Sentiment analysis.
    * Content modertation.  
    
    
* Anomaly detection
    * Software security and breach detection.
    * Data center failure prediction.  
    
    
* Fraud and spam detection.
    * Credit card / paymet fraud
    * Email spam / phishing.  
    
    
* Recommendation systems.
    * Pandora/Spotify styled "radio".
    * Netflix.
    * Amazon.
    * Advertising networks.  


* Generative models.
    * Art and music creation
    * "Deep Fakes".
    * Auto-blogging.
    * Image upscaling.
    * Image colorization.  


* Continuous decision making agents.
    * Self operating vehicles & robotics control.
    * Playing games.   


* Forecasting.
    * Financial modeling. 
    * Stock purchasing.
    * Weather prediction.  


* Bioinformatics & Pharmaceuticals
    * Phenotype prediction.
    * Drug discovery.
    * Genetic engineering.

## Questions to Ask (~25 minutes)

Once you've picked a topic, you'll be exploring it! Here are some interesting questions you might try to answer about your topic:

* What is the current state of the art in this domain?
    * How successful are the most successful models?
    * How far along the road to commodification is this technology?
    
    
* What kinds of models are popular in this domain?
    * How is data prepared for consumption by these models?
    * What is the output of these models?
    * How is that output used / interpreted?
    
    
* What is the practical application?
    * How are the models deployed?
    * Where are they used, and to what ends?
    
    
* What is the benefit to using AI/ML rather than something else?
    * Why automate this task?
    * Why is a computer preferable to a human?
    * Or, how does the computer complement the human aspects of the solution?
    
    
* What are the risks?
    * What are the potential sources of bias?
    * Are there any well-documented failures to learn from?

## Discussion (~15 minutes)

As a class, we'll ask each group to summarize their findings, and have a discussion about those findings.
