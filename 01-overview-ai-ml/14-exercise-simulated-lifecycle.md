# Exercise: Simulated ML Lifecycle

In this exercise you'll work in small teams to simulate the ML lifecycle for a single application of ML.

## Discussion Topics:

Try to define at least the following with regards to your chosen topic:

1. What data will you need to perform this task?
    * What sources of data are available to you?
    * What types of errors are likely to be in those data sources?
    * What kind of cleaning and preprocessing do you anticipate using?
    * What are the "features" and what are the labels?
    * What forms of feature extraction/engineering and preprocessing might you use?
2. What metrics will you track, and how might you define failure and success with respect to those metrics.
3. What are the risks and benefits of using ML to solve this problem?
4. What kind of models do you anticipate working well?
    * Can you start simple?
    * Can you form a hypothesis about the relationship between the input features and the labels?
    * Are there existing systems you can use as inspiration or as a starting point?
5. What does deployment look like?
    * To the device?
    * To a the server with an API?
    * What infrastructure might be needed?
6. What does monitoring look like?
    * What data will you capture?
    * Are there any events you can describe abstractly that you'd like to produce a realtime notification?
    * How might you audit your system's performance "in the wild" using the data you capture?
